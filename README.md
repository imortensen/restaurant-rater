# restaurant-rater

I created this project to help me learn Node.js. It is the server for https://github.com/imortensen/restaurant-rater-client. 

It supports a restaurant rating web app that allows users to find and rate restaurants. 

This project uses passport for authentication using the following strageties: googleToken, local, and JWT. It also uses Google Places API to support search of a restaurant based on a keyword for a certain location.
